# Organic Tech

This mod is centered around biological-themed technology and automation. It is still in early development so this repository doesn't have much more than the Forge MDK and some blocks to constitute the bare minimum of a Minecraft mod.

# Contact

Development of this mod is coordinated through the Discord server *Jeefle's Marsh*. If you have any questions or this mod looks interesting to you, feel free to come say hello!
